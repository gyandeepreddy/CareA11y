819,phase 1 drug trial,"initial study of a new drug in humans to determine limits of
tolerance. the first use of a new drug in humans happens in a
phase 1 study. these studies are usually conducted with healthy
volunteers; but if a drug is very poisonous, or is used to treat a
deadly disease, sick patients who have that disease might be
subjects. usually, there are about 20 ‚Äì 80 human subjects in
phase 1 studies.
phase 1 trials are conducted to see how the drug acts in the
body, if it is safe to use, and to find out the safe dose range. if
the results of the phase 1 studies are good, testing continues in
phase 2 studies."
820,phase 2 drug trial,"second phase of study of a new drug intended to obtain initial
information. phase 2 trials include controlled clinical studies to
see if a new drug is effective to treat for a particular disease or
condition; therefore, the subjects who are given the drug have
the condition that the drug is supposed to treat. the side effects
are also studied, and more information is gathered about the
best dose. phase 2 studies are also conducted with a relatively
small number of patients, usually involving no more than
several hundred subjects.
if the evidence from the phase 2 studies shows that a drug is
probably effective and relatively safe, phase 3 studies are
conducted."
821,phase 3 drug trial,"large-scale trial to confirm and expand information on safety
and usefulness of a new drug. during phase 3 trials, the new
drug is given to a larger number of patients in different clinical
settings to gather as much information as possible about the
drug's safety and effectiveness, the best dosage, and to gather
labeling information.
investigators also want to make sure that the drug has more
benefits than risk. for example, a drug meant to treat a deadly
disease, like some cancers, may have very bad side effects. but,
if it can stop the cancer, the side effects may be considered
acceptable. on the other hand, even if a drug is very effective in
the treatment of a common headache, for example, but has bad side effects, that drug would be considered too toxic
(poisonous) to be used to treat that condition.
in phase 3 studies, the drug is used the way it would be
administered when marketed. when these studies are completed
and the sponsor believes that the drug is safe and effective, the
sponsor applies to the fda for approval to market the drug.
phase 3 trials usually involve several hundred to several
thousand patient-subjects."
822,phase 4 drug trial,"as a condition of approval, fda may want more studies to get
additional information about the drug's risks, benefits, and
optimal use. these studies, which are phase 4 trials, could
include, but would not be limited to, studying different doses or
schedules of administration than were used in phase 2 studies,
studying the drug in other patient populations or other stages of
the disease, or studying the drug when given over a longer
period of time than recommended on the label."
